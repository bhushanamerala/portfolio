-CSS
-Javascript

##Instructions:
1.Create a new HTML file that sets up the basic structure of a portfolio website for a software engineer. Use semantic HTML tags (header, main, footer) and include placeholder comments for each future section (hero, about, skills, timeline, projects, etc.). Also, include a placeholder for a night mode toggle.

2.Develop the hero section at the top of the page. Use CSS to implement a abstract art style design and add a background image of your choice. Incorporate a night mode toggle that uses CSS media queries to detect the user's default browser theme. Ensure the section welcomes visitors with a title and a brief tagline.@index.html Ensure the CSS is in the different file and link it to the html file.

3.Design a vertical navigation bar that will be placed on the left side of the screen. Include links for 'Home', 'About Me', 'Skills', 'Timeline', 'Projects', 'Testimonials', 'Chat', and 'Contact'. Style the navbar using CSS so that it stands out while complementing the abstract art aesthetic, and ensure it's accessible and responsive.

5.@BP.jpeg Add this as the photo of the person in the hero section.

6.Build the 'About Me' section. write a short bio describing the software engineer. Use a clean, minimalistic design and include a brief introduction about career highlights or personal interests.

7.Develop a 'Skills' section that highlights the software engineer's core competencies. Create a visually engaging layout that lists key skills-such as programming languages, frameworks, and tools-using progress bars, icons, or styled lists. Ensure that the section maintains the abstract art aesthetic and overall design consistency. Include brief comments in your code to explain how each element represents a specific skill, and consider adding subtle animations or hover effects to enhance interactivity.

8.set the Databases and tools,technologies under the technical skills.

9.Create a timeline component beneath the 'Skills' section. This timeline should list key events (education, major projects, career milestones) in a visually engaging manner. Use rounded boxes or cards and CSS transitions to add a smooth hover effect. Keep the design minimalistic and coherent with the overall theme.

10.Develop a 'Projects' section that displays several project thumbnails. Each thumbnail should be clickable and open a detailed view or link to the project. Style the thumbnails with consistent margins, padding, and hover effects. Add comments in your code to explain how each thumbnail is connected to its project detail.

11.change the name from YourName to Bhushana Merala.

12.change the name from YD to BM in the left side top nav bar.

13.highlight the name Bhushana Merala in the "about me" section.

14.Develop a 'Projects' section that displays several project thumbnails. Each thumbnail should be clickable and open a detailed view or link to the project. Style the thumbnails with consistent margins, padding, and hover effects. Add comments in your code to explain how each thumbnail is connected to its project detail. Also add glowing border .@pro.jpeg  add this image to all the thumbnails properly.

15.Implement a chat section that allows visitors to interact with an Al version of the portfolio owner. Create a chat window interface with an input field and a display area for messages. Include basic JavaScript to simulate sending/receiving messages, and leave comments indicating where an API (like OpenAl) could be integrated later.
